<div id="text">
【35】Kei Nishikori joined a tennis academy when he was a junior high school student, just like you. He was small, but he had a special talent. He could hit the ball very hard and was very smart in sports.
　However, Kei did not like running training at first. He only enjoyed playing tennis on the court. But his coach explained that running makes legs strong. When Kei understood this, he changed his attitude. He started to run and train very hard to become faster. He made a great effort to become a strong player.
　Kei is also special because of his mental strength. In a match, there are often difficult and nervous moments. Many players play safely or make mistakes in these times. However, Kei is different. He plays his best tennis during the most important points. When the game is close, he plays at a higher level.
　Top players win because they get the important points. Kei became a world-class player because he worked hard on training he did not like, and he stayed strong in big matches.
